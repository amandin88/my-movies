# my-movies
2nd application from scratch while learning React Native / Expo.

In this project, I applied what I learned regarding: 
  - the navigation
  - the states management
  - Redux
  
Regarding the functionalities, the app is divided in 3 tabs: 
 - Movies: the user can displayed each movies / category
 - Watched: displayed all the watched movies
 - Favorites: displayed all the favorites movies
 
 On the movie detail screen, the user can 
  - add the movie to the favorite and / or watched list
  - remove the movies from the application
